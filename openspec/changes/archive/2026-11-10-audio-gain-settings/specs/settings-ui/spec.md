# Spec Delta

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Audio card
The Settings tab SHALL have an "Audio" card with a slider for "What the assistant hears"
(the input gain) and one for "How loud the assistant speaks" (the output gain), each from 0
to 400 % with its current percentage shown, plus the earcon switch and the earcon volume. A
change SHALL be saved automatically, without a Save button.

#### Scenario: Moving a slider
- **WHEN** the user moves "What the assistant hears" to 339 %
- **THEN** the label shows 339 %, the setting is saved as 3.39 without pressing a button, and a restart shows the same value

#### Scenario: Rejected value
- **WHEN** a save fails
- **THEN** the card shows the error next to the slider and the slider returns to the stored value
